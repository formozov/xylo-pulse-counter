The <a HREF="http://www.knjn.com/">KNJN</A> <A
HREF="http://www.knjn.com/FPGA-FX2.html">Saxo</A> is a USB-attached
FPGA with a variety of uses.  This webpage is devoted to using the
Saxo from Linux.

<P>
The Saxo is based around two chips: the FX2, which is an 8051-based
USB-2 device and an <A HREF="http://www.altera.com/">Altera</A> <A
HREF="http://www.altera.com/products/devices/cyclone/cyc-index.jsp">Cyclone</A>
FPGA.  Linux work with the FX2 is best done using the <A
HREF="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net">sdcc</A> cross compiler (available
on Debian Linux; but only the non-free <TT>sdcc-nf</TT> package supports the
8051 architecture) coupled with Wolfgang Wieser's toolset, most
importantly <A
HREF="http://www.triplespark.net/elec/periph/USB-FX2/software/"><TT>cycfx2prog</TT></A>
(at least version 0.46) and <A
HREF="http://www.triplespark.net/elec/periph/USB-FX2/software/local_examples.html"><TT>usb-fx2-local-examples</TT></A>
(you need at least the include files).

<P>
All of the <TT>usb-fx2-local-examples</TT> work unmodified on the
Saxo, since they just use the FX2 without the FPGA.  To use the FPGA,
you'll also need <A
HREF="saxo_loader-1.0.tgz"><TT>saxo_loader</TT></A>.  Unpack the
program into to same directory you unpacked
<TT>usb-fx2-local-examples</TT>, cross-compile it using make/sdcc,
then boot load it over USB using cycfx2prog.  Upon initialization, it
resets the FPGA and places it into its Passive Serial configuration
mode.  Anything received by bulk transfer over endpoint 1 (which
should be an Altera .rbf file) is then clocked out to the FPGA's
configuration pins.  It also puts endpoints 2, 4, 6, and 8 into the
default configuration documented in the Saxo manual, which presents
them as FIFO buffers to the FPGA.  It has been tested with the
LEDblink, LEDglow, FX2_LEDs, and FX2_bidir examples from the Saxo
Startup Kit.

<P>
The code does not (directly) support programming the Saxo's EEPROMs.
Doing so would require loading an FPGA bitfile that implemented an I2C
controller (to program the FX2's optional EEPROM) and/or something to
implement Altera's EPCS protocol (to program the FPGA's EEPROM).  This
should be doable with little modification to saxo_loader.  However, to
load the FPGA from its EEPROM, the program would have to be modified
to put the FPGA into Active Serial configuration mode upon startup.
See the source code for more detail.

<P>
The code is covered under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

<H3>Usage example</H3>
<P>
 (<TT>FX2_bidir_SaxoXylo.rbf</TT> is from the Saxo Startup Kit)
<P>
<PRE>
   cycfx2prog prg:saxo_loader.ihx run fbulk:1,FX2_bidir_SaxoXylo.rbf
   cycfx2prog "sbulk:2,This is a test"
   cycfx2prog dbulk:6,-512
</PRE>

<P>
<TT>FX2_bidir_SaxoXylo</TT> programs the FPGA to count characters, so the
last command should return a character count of 0x0e.
